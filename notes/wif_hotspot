WORKAROUND (for Ubuntu at least):

 

1. Temporarily allow 0.0.0.0/0 to SSH into the EC2 instance

2. At the commandline prompt, type 

echo $SSH_CONNECTION

You'll get two IPs back, each with a port :

166.172.254.1 16697 172.31.1.2 22

3. Verify that the second one matches the public IP you see in the Mac browser at whatismyip.com. 

4. If so, add the *first* one to your firewall or AWS Security Group rule. Allow all traffic (or just the ports you want) using restrictive CIDR "166.172.254.1/32" to limit it to your device only.

5. *Be sure* to remove the 0.0.0.0/0 public entry to re-secure the environment.

 

No instance or device restart is required. Should work immediately.
